I could have made a method for when the player got a correct guess instead of making a listener for each button that was correct.
Also this way the program would have worked for more than just the word "APPLE."  I'm really not too sure of much else I could
have done to reuse code or simplify what I did.  I did use a lot of buttons and labels and image icons so if there is a way to 
perhaps make a for loop to keep creating buttons while still keeping the names of them separate I could have done so.  Most of
my code was just creating components to add to the panels that I made and setting up listeners for them.  Since java and android
have a different way of making new components, it was near impossible to copy and reuse code from java to android in making 
these components.  I could have set it up to where the user inputs a character from the alphabet and then gone through a for loop
to see if the letter they entered was in the word and for each instance of that letter make it appear on the screen.  If the
for loop didn't find any instance of the letter then I could have added a body part to the hangman image. 
This way there would not have been any buttons to make for each letter of the alphabet and would have allowed me to use far less
code and far less to write in the xml file.   I think in my case it is more a matter of writing less code 
to begin with rather than reusing code.
