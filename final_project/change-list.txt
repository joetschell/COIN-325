I had to add in JLabels and JImageIcons for each of the underscores under each of the letters
I also had to do the same for adding each new body part to the gallows. I made a new image
and set a label to that image for each new body part that was added to the hangman.  I ended up
not using the continuePrevious() method because I did not know how to save progress from a game
that was started and not completed all the way.  I put the main class to run the program on its 
own instead of having it as a part of the StartMenu class as well.  I added integer variables to
keep track of how the correct number of guesses and incorrect number of guesses so the program
would know when the user won (when the number of correct guesses equals the length of the word)
and the when the user lost (when the number of incorrect guesses matched the number of body
parts). I hard coded separate listeners for all the buttons that were correct guesses due to time 
restraints and for the buttons that were incorrect guesses I had one listener since it did 
not matter what letter it was as long as it wasn't a letter that was in the word.
